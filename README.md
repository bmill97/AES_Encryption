How to run my file:

Compile with gcc -Wall Lab1.c 
Run with ./a.out [x]

Default functionality (just ./a.out) is to run the AppendixC values with Debug statements

Replace x with 1 for Auto Grader values, 2 for AppendixC without debug statements, 3 for My Debugging statements.

My code passes all test cases in Appendix C. There is one small white space issue with the rounds in 192/256, but the values are correct.
